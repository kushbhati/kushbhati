# 📋 Current Projects

- ### 📌 [CodeCam](https://github.com/kushbhati/CodeCam)
  - code (like *Morse*) communication using your *Camera* and *Camera Flash*
  - uses C++ as well, so it'll take some time
  - trying my best to implement 'clean' architecture
  
- ### 📌 [GameClockLegacy](https://github.com/kushbhati/GameClockLegacy)
  - self-explainatory I guess, Its like a chess-clock, but "*for all games*"
  - 'legacy' because of my exceptional ability to write instant-legacy code
